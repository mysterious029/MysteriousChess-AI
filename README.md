# MysteriousChess-AI
Created a robust and efficient chess engine that can generate and evaluate chess positions,make legal moves, and handle various aspects of the game, including castling, en passantcaptures, and pawn promotion. Implement well-known chess algorithms, such as MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) and can .see 10 moves ahead each game.â€¢ Implement machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning or deep learning, toenable the AI to learn and adapt its strategies based on past games and experiences.
